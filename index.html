            <h2>Evaluation of Font Sizes</h2>
            <p>As per your request, I have evaluated the font sizes in the previous design. The main heading (h1) was set at 35px, which is appropriate for the primary title. Subheadings (h2) were at 30px, providing clear hierarchy. Other content (paragraphs) was at 27px, which falls within your specified range of no less than 26px and no more than 27px. I have maintained these sizes in the updated CSS, ensuring the body text remains at 27px for readability and elegance.</p>

            <h2>Foreword by Scott Hahn</h2>
            <h3>Summary of the Foreword</h3>
            <p>Scott Hahn introduces Edward Sri's book as originating from a Bible study proposal twenty years ago, praising Sri's ability to make scholarly insights accessible. He emphasizes the kingdom of God as both promised and delivered through the Church, highlighting Jesus as Messiah-King and Emmanuel.</p>
            <h3>Teacher-Like Explanation</h3>
            <p>Imagine we are in a classroom discussing the foundations of Christian theology. Scott Hahn, like a wise mentor, reminds us that Jesus' kingdom isn't a distant dream but a present reality in the Church. This counters critics who say Jesus promised a kingdom but left only the Church—Hahn shows they are one and the same. For example, think of a family inheritance: promised in a will, but realized when claimed. Jesus' life fulfills Old Testament promises, much like how a puzzle comes together. In modern terms, it's like a startup idea (promise) becoming a global company (Church). Key concept: Fulfillment—Jesus embodies prophecies, inviting us to deeper love for his kingdom.</p>

            <h2>Introduction: God with Us</h2>
            <h3>Summary of the Introduction</h3>
            <p>Sri shifts focus from Jesus' death to his life, portraying his mission to build God's kingdom. Jesus as Emmanuel restores communion lost since Eden, facing controversy for associating with outcasts.</p>
            <h3>Teacher-Like Explanation</h3>
            <p>Let us sit together as students of Scripture. Why did Jesus live? Not merely to die, but to inaugurate a kingdom where God dwells with humanity. Picture Adam and Eve's separation—Jesus bridges that chasm. For instance, his Sermon on the Mount isn't random advice but kingdom blueprint. Today, like a community organizer uniting divided neighborhoods, Jesus includes sinners. Concept: Restoration—through actions like healing lepers, he shows God's inclusive love. Comparison: Modern reconciliation efforts in conflicted regions mirror Jesus' outreach.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 1: The Return of the King (Matthew 1)</h2>
            <h3>Summary of Chapter 1</h3>
            <p>Matthew's genealogy excites Jews by linking Jesus to David, signaling kingdom restoration after exile. It includes flawed figures, emphasizing grace, and introduces Emmanuel.</p>
            <h3>Teacher-Like Explanation</h3>
            <p>Gather around, class. Genealogies seem dull, but for first-century Jews, this was electrifying—like discovering a lost royal heir. Jesus as David's son promises liberation. Example: Rahab's inclusion shows God's redemptive power. Modern parallel: Ancestry tests revealing surprising heritage, reminding us of divine inclusion. Concept: Covenant renewal—Israel's hope revives in Jesus. Bursting with complexity: Flawed ancestors foreshadow grace for all.</p>

            <h3>Summary of Chapter 2</h3>
            <p>Jesus' infancy fulfills Old Testament prophecies, portraying him as new Moses. Magi follow star, Herod massacres innocents, family flees to Egypt.</p>
            <h3>Teacher-Like Explanation</h3>
            <p>Students, Scripture isn't isolated—Jesus climaxes Old Testament narrative. Like film sequels resolving plots, Matthew connects events. Example: Star prophecy from Numbers. Modern: Refugees fleeing persecution, echoing Holy Family. Concept: Typology—patterns repeat with greater meaning.</p>
