            <h2>Our Journey Begins: Finding the Right Glasses</h2>
            <p class="sub-title">Why We Must Learn to See Jesus as a First-Century Jew</p>
            <p>Welcome, students, to our exploration of Matthew's Gospel. Before we open to the first page, we have to ask a critical question: what glasses are we wearing? If we read this ancient text with 21st-century eyes, the story will seem flat, some parts will feel strange, and the true genius will be lost. Our goal is to take off our modern glasses and put on a pair of first-century Jewish ones. Why? Because Matthew was writing for them, and he assumed they knew the whole backstory—the epic tale of Israel.</p>
            <p>The central theme, our guiding star for this entire journey, is the name Matthew gives to Jesus: <strong>Emmanuel</strong>, which means "God with us." This isn't just a beautiful title; it's a mission statement. Jesus's entire life was dedicated to closing the chasm that sin had opened between God and humanity. He came to be God *with* us, so we could once again be with God.</p>
            <p>To see this, we must recognize Jesus as the <strong>Messiah-King</strong>. Forget the gentle, stained-glass-window Jesus for a moment. Think of a long-lost king, the heir to a legendary dynasty, returning to a nation living under bitter occupation. He has come to reclaim his throne and establish his kingdom. This is the electrifying drama Matthew unfolds. He is a meticulous teacher, carefully showing how Jesus is the stunning fulfillment of every hope, every prophecy, and every story his audience held dear.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1: The Return of the King (Matthew 1 )</h3>
            <p class="sub-title">The Royal Proclamation Hidden in a "Boring" List</p>
            <p>Alright class, let's be honest. When you see a long list of "begats," your eyes glaze over. You're tempted to skip to the action, right? But for Matthew's audience, this genealogy was the action. It was the front-page, headline news they had been waiting centuries for. Let's break down why this "boring" list is actually a royal birth certificate with explosive implications.</p>
            <p>First, Matthew declares Jesus is the <strong>"Son of David."</strong> This is his thesis statement. But he doesn't just say it; he proves it with a hidden code. He arranges the names into three sets of fourteen generations. This isn't a coincidence. In the Hebrew alphabet, letters have numerical values. The name "David" (D-W-D) adds up to 14 (D=4, W=6, D=4). It's a brilliant, subtle way of shouting from the rooftops: "This Jesus is David, David, David! He is the ultimate king!"</p>
            <p>Now, notice the pivot point in the list: the <strong>Babylonian Exile</strong>. This was the moment the kingdom died, the moment the line of Davidic kings was cut off. For the Jews, this wasn't just history; it was a present reality of pain and humiliation under Roman rule. They felt like a people still in exile. The genealogy builds this historical tension, this memory of loss, and then resolves it in one name: Jesus, the "Christ"—the anointed Messiah. His name, *Yeshua*, means "God saves." He is the answer to the exile, because he has come to save his people from the sin that caused it in the first place. He is the king who has come to finally bring them home.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Teacher's Analogy: The Broken Crown</h4>
                <p>Imagine a museum displaying a magnificent royal crown, but with a large piece missing. The plaque explains that the piece was lost when the kingdom fell centuries ago. For generations, people have stared at that gap, a symbol of their lost glory. Then one day, a master jeweler arrives, not with a replica, but with the original, long-lost piece. He fits it into place, and the crown is whole again. The genealogy is that story. The exile is the broken piece. Jesus is the one who makes the royal line—and the hopes of his people—whole again.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Fulfilling All Prophecy (Matthew 2)</h3>
            <p class="sub-title">When History Rhymes: Finding the Divine Pattern</p>
            <p>If Chapter 1 was the legal document, Chapter 2 is the historical proof. Matthew continues to build his case, showing that Jesus's early life wasn't a series of random events, but a divine pattern, a rhyme with Israel's sacred history. He uses a teaching method called <strong>typology</strong>, where a person or event in the Old Testament serves as a "type" or a blueprint for something Jesus fulfills.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a movie "remake." The plot is familiar, but the new version is grander, deeper, and reveals the ultimate meaning of the original. Matthew presents two major "remakes" here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jesus as the New Moses:</strong> Let's look at the parallels. A wicked, paranoid ruler (Pharaoh/Herod) orders the slaughter of innocent Hebrew boys. A child, destined to be a savior, miraculously escapes. He finds refuge in Egypt. Later, he will return to liberate his people. This is the story of Moses, and Matthew shows it is also the story of Jesus. He is signaling to us: if Moses was the great liberator and lawgiver, then Jesus is the *greater* one. He will lead a new, more profound Exodus—not from bondage in Egypt, but from bondage to sin and death.</li>
                <li><strong>The Magi as the New Balaam:</strong> This one is more subtle, but even more brilliant. In the Old Testament (Numbers 22-24), a pagan king, Balak, hires a seer from the East named Balaam to curse Israel. But God foils the plan, and Balaam ends up blessing Israel and prophesying that "a star shall come out of Jacob" to signal a future king. Now, fast forward to Matthew 2. A new pagan king, Herod, tries to use seers from the East (the Magi) for his own evil ends. But once again, God foils the plan. The Magi, guided by a star, end up blessing and worshipping the true King. Matthew is showing his readers that the ancient prophecy of Balaam is being fulfilled right before their eyes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through these echoes, Matthew teaches a profound truth: God is the author of history, and all the old stories were just foreshadowing the main event—the arrival of His Son.</p>

            <h2>Our Final Lesson: Living as Citizens of the Kingdom</h2>
            <p class="sub-title">What the Author Wants Us to Take Away from This Study</p>
            <p>Class, we have traveled from the royal genealogy to the empty tomb. We have seen Jesus as the New Moses, the New David, the true Temple, and the ultimate Passover Lamb. So, what now? What is the final lesson Edward Sri, through his deep reading of Matthew, wants us to carry out of this classroom and into our lives? It is not simply to be impressed by the theology, but to be transformed by the King.</p>

                <h4>The Teacher's Final Exam: Four Core Truths to Live By</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Become a Biblical Detective:</strong> The first lesson is a call to intellectual conversion. We can no longer be passive readers of the Bible. Sri teaches us that the Old and New Testaments are a divine dialogue. To understand Jesus, we must understand the promises he came to fulfill. The challenge is to become "biblical detectives," constantly asking, "What Old Testament story is echoing here? What prophecy is being fulfilled?" This approach turns Bible reading from a duty into a lifelong adventure of discovery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Understand True Power:</strong> Our world defines power as domination, wealth, and influence. Jesus's kingdom turns this upside down. True power, as Sri shows through Matthew, is found in humility, service, and sacrificial love. The Sermon on the Mount is the constitution of this new kingdom. The Cross is its throne. The lesson for us is to re-evaluate our own ambitions. Are we seeking to "lord it over" others in our work or family, or are we seeking to be the "servant of all"? This is the daily choice of a kingdom citizen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Your Life is a Mission, Not a Spectacle:</strong> The Great Commission at the end of Matthew is not just a historical command; it is our personal marching order. Sri wants us to realize that we are not spectators watching the story of Jesus from the stands. We have been drafted onto the team. Our mission is to extend the borders of his kingdom of light and love in our own small corners of the world. Every act of kindness, every word of truth, every prayer for an enemy is an act of building the kingdom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Live in the Reality of "Emmanuel":</strong> This is the most important lesson of all, the one that makes all the others possible. The promise of "God with us" is not a sentimental platitude. It is the source of all Christian power and joy. Sri emphasizes that this presence is real and accessible. When we feel weak, we can turn to Christ in the Eucharist. When we feel lost, we can hear his voice in Scripture. When we feel alone, we can find him in the community of the Church. The ultimate lesson is to live with the profound, unshakeable confidence that the King is with us, always, to the very end of the age.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Thank you for taking this journey. The goal was never just to understand the Gospel of Matthew, but to allow the Gospel of Matthew to understand us, and to reshape us into more faithful and courageous citizens of the kingdom of "God with us."</p>
